A graph is a data structure that shares similar elements with a binary tree.
The graph consists of vertices (also referred to as nodes; data) and edges, which are
lines or arcs connecting any two vertices (nodes) in a graph.
In conclusion a graph is composed of a set of vertices (V) and a set of edges (E) -
G(E,V).
Graphs can be directed or undirected. If edges have directions between vertices they are part of a directed graph - think
Webpages. Whereas undirected graphs are like social networks.
